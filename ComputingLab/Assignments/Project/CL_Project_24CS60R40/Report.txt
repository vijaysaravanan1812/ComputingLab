Average Latency Analysis
------------------------------------

Create Latency: Remains stable with a minor increase at 10,000 operations, likely due to slight memory or I/O overhead.

Write Latency: Low across tests but rises slightly at 10,000 operations, suggesting increased I/O load.

Read Latency: Minimal at 100 and 1,000 operations, with a noticeable increase at 10,000, indicating slower read speeds with larger datasets.

Delete Latency: Consistently low, showing efficient deletion regardless of operation count.

------------------------------------
CPU Utilization Analysis
------------------------------------

100 Operations: CPU usage fluctuates moderately (10–23%), indicating a light load with intervals of low activity.

1,000 Operations: CPU demand intensifies, peaking up to 41%, likely due to more frequent I/O or processing.

10,000 Operations: CPU utilization rises significantly, frequently hitting 45–60%, showing a heavier processing load as operations scale.
